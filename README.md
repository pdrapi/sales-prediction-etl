**Authors**: Piotr Drapiński, Emma Döffinger, Ivana Jasna Caltagirone

This repository contains the technical part of the final exam project for the course "Applied Machine Learning and Data Engineering in Business Context." The primary goal of the project was to design an ETL process using Azure functionalities, integrating MLOps principles.

## Project Overview
The project focuses on predicting car seat sales using this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohannapd/linear-regression-sales-prediction-of-carseats.

## Methodology
The technical analysis includes:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Model training and evaluation using Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and ensemble methods.
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
- Evaluation metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared (R²).

## Azure-based ETL Process
The core objective was to design an ETL process using Azure products and analyze it from a business perspective, ensuring a robust MLOps pipeline. The project features an ETL diagram illustrating the integration of various Azure functionalities.


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning and MLOps in a business context, highlighting the design of an ETL process with Azure products. The technical analysis provides insights into key predictors of car seat sales, aiding in data-driven decision-making.
